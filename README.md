## Developer Setup

Use sdkman to manage java versions. Install sdkman by following the instructions [here](https://sdkman.io/install).
You could also enable automatically switching to the correct version of java when you cd into this directory.
This can be configured by updating the config in `~/.sdkman/etc/config` to `sdkman_auto_env=true`
Run the command below to install the configured version of java:

    sdk env install
